Now you can make a git, clone it and change it.
Let us prepare for JavaScript

1. Make a repo
2. Call it JavaScriptAssignments
3. Copy the URL
4. Share it here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bx47Icsl6VDyaCy-k5YdfpH7pVUey8p2uzELX4IK_wg/edit?usp=sharing
5. Every time you make an assigment in JavaScript make a folder with the theme name in git and push it, so we can see it



Lets use Git together
1. Go in groups
2. One in the group makes a repo in Github
3. The owner of the adds the rest of the group as collaborator to that repo
4. The group clone the repo with help from Git bash/terminal
5. Make a website that tells you, what git is, and how to use the different git commands
6. Upload it on github
7. One of the group members adds/change some file and upload it to the repo
8. The other group members download the new code
9. Do it again, but with a diffrent group member, so every one tries it


Lets see what git else can
1. Look up git branch
2. Make a website (or add a new page on the one before) that tells you what git branch and how you can use it
3. Try make a git branch
